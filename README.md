## 📁 Project Structure

The repository is organized into packages corresponding to each day of the challenge.

Each `src/dayX` package contains:
* The `.kt` file(s) with the source code and solution logic (e.g., `Day1_1and2.kt`, `Day3_1.kt`, `Day3_2.kt`).
* A `test_input_dayX` file containing the puzzle input for that day.
